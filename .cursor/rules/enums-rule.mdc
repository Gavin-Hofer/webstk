# Enums Rule

In general, do not use enums in typescript files. Instead use string unions.
This is because enums have weird and unpredicatble behavior in typescript.

```ts
// BAD
enum DayOfWeek {
  Sunday = 'Sunday',
  Monday = 'Monday',
  Tuesday = 'Tuesday',
  Wednesday = 'Wednesday',
  Thursday = 'Thursday',
  Friday = 'Friday',
  Saturday = 'Saturday',
}

// GOOD
type DayOfWeek =
  | 'Sunday'
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Sunday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday';

// ALSO GOOD
const DayOfWeek = {
  Sunday: 'Sunday',
  Monday: 'Monday',
  Tuesday: 'Tuesday',
  Wednesday: 'Wednesday',
  Thursday: 'Thursday',
  Friday: 'Friday',
  Saturday: 'Saturday',
};
type DayOfWeek = (typeof DayOfWeek)[keyof typeof DayOfWeek]
```

If the user creates an enum in the file they're working on, suggest changing it to one of the other methods.
