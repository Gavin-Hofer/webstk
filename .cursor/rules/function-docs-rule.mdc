# Function documentation format

Function documentation for exported functions should be in this format. React components can exclude the @returns part.

```ts
/**
 * Short, one sentence description of the function or component.
 * 
 * Optional, detailed description if necessary.
 *
 * Conditions: // Any conditions that the inputs have to meet or else a failure result will be returned. Omit for react components.
 *  - Condition 1
 *  - Condition 2
 *  - Condition 3
 * 
 * Assumptions:  // Any assumptions about the inputs that would cause an error to be thrown if violated. Do not include if no errors are thrown. Omit for React components.
 *  - Assumption 1
 *  - Assumption 2
 *  - Assumption 3
 *
 * Mutations: // Any database mutations
 *  - Mutation 1
 *  - Mutation 2
 *  - Mutation 3
 *
 * Side Effects: // Any side effects outside of mutations (e.g. in external APIs).
 *  - Side effect 1
 *  - Side effect 2
 *
 * @param input - The input parameters object.
 * @param input.property1 - Description of first property
 * @param input.property2 - Description of second property
 * @returns Brief description of the return value.
 */
export function exampleFunction(input: {
  property1: string;
  property2: boolean;
}): ReturnType {
  // Function implementation
}
```

Note: 
 - The sections `Assumptions`, `Mutations`, and `Side Effects` are optional and should only be included when relevant. Additional sections can be included where neccessary.
 - Make sure all inputs, outputs, and side effects are documented.
 - Provide additional explanation only when the short description is not enough.
 - @returns should be ommitted for any 

If the user types "doc", then apply this style of documentation to all exported functions in the file, and add the short description to any non-exported functions that do not already have them.
