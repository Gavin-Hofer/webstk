# Check Docs

If the user says "check docs", then check the function documentation of the main function in the file.
- First, go over the function docs to understand what is intended.
- Then go through the code in detail, making sure it matches the function docs. Look specifically for inputs, outputs, and side effects.
- If you see any bahavior that does not match the docs, let the user know.

The final output should be formatted like this:

✅ Documented feature matches code implementation
⚠ Un-documented feature (input, output or side effect), or code implementation for feature does not match documented behavior.
❌ Documented behavior is missing from code implementation.
